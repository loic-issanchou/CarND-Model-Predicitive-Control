## Rubric Points

* The model
The kinematic model used is the same used in the lesson. It take into account the vehicle's x and y coordinates, the orientation angle (psi), the velocity (v), the cross-track error (cte) and psi error (epsi). These variables are included in the state.
The actuators are the acceleration (throttle_value) and the steering (steer_value).
The update equations are given in the lesson. They uses the actuations and state from the previous timestep to calculate the current state.

* Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
First, I used the same configuration that in the lesson, ie N=25 and dt=.05. 
But with the timestep length at 25, I had some errors prediction that put the car off the lane. So I reduced the timestep length at 15. It was good for the global prediction, ie a corner was correctly detected. But, I had much oscillations. It was due to my third degree polynomial combines with a short duration. Indeed, when the different points prediction are not align or not "circular", and when these points are close together, the third degree polynomial must much oscille in order to target these points. So the steering value vary a lot. However, if the points predictions are far together, then the third degree polynomial is much smoother. For these reason, I have chosen a duration value at 0.1s. So, at this moment, my configuration was N=15 and dt=0.1s.
But with this configuration, I had sometimes a few bad predictions. 
So finally, I have chosen the configuration follows : N=10, dt=0.1s.

* Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
The waypoints are preprocessed by transforming them to the vehicle's coordinate system. So now the vehicle is at the origin of the frame. Also, the new orientation angle is now zero. The estimation of the polynomial is thus facilitated.

* Model Predictive Control with Latency
Before send the current state to the MPC procedure, I applied a latency of 0.1s. It useful to predict where the vehicle will be in 100ms and so what will be the actuations to do to minimize the errors given that the actuations will take effect in only 100ms after the current state.
So, for that, I predicted the state after 100ms based on the current state and current actuations. 
Then, the predicted state can be send to the MPC procedure to calculate the next actuations necessary to keep the car on the road.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
